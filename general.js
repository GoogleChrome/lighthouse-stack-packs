  'modern-image-formats': 'Image formats like JPEG 2000, JPEG XR, and WebP often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/webp).',

  'total-byte-weight': 'Large network payloads cost users real money and are highly correlated with long load times. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/network-payloads).',
  'render-blocking-resources': 'Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/blocking-resources).',

  'efficient-animated-content': 'Large GIFs are inefficient for delivering animated content. Consider using MPEG4/WebM videos for animations and PNG/WebP for static images instead of GIF to save network bytes. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video/)',
  'unused-javascript': 'Remove unused JavaScript to reduce bytes consumed by network activity.',

Consider reducing the length of chains, reducing the download size of resources, or deferring the download of unnecessary resources to improve page load. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/critical-request-chains).',
  'dom-size': 'Browser engineers recommend pages contain fewer than ~1,500 DOM nodes. The sweet spot is a tree depth < 32 elements and fewer than 60 children/parent element. A large DOM can increase memory usage, cause longer [style calculations](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/reduce-the-scope-and-complexity-of-style-calculations), and produce costly [layout reflows](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/browser-reflow).
