When you encounter an image in a different format, check whether it is being served from a third party source. If so, consider uploading it from the Wix Media Manager instead.

  "offscreen-images": "Images are automatically lazy loaded in most scenarios. Offscreen images may be downloaded below the viewport. These are very small, low-resolution placeholder images which are fast to load. As the user scrolls down the page, these placeholders are replaced by high-resolution images. This serves the same purpose as lazy loading.

When [using third-party code](https://support.wix.com/en/article/site-performance-using-third-party-code-on-your-site) on your site, it’s important to add it in a non-blocking manner. For example, you can add defer or async attributes to your third-party script. You can also place the script at the end of the code body to ensure that your regular site content doesn’t get delayed or prevented from rendering.",

If not, consider removing or replacing them with an optimized alternative. Any code delivered through static.parastorage.com is packaged by Wix. It's crucial to your site's structure, so it can't be modified or deleted. We are consistently optimizing these files using methods such as code splitting, dynamic imports and using web workers to reduce main thread blocking JavaScript in order to minimize input delays and make sure that sites load quickly, regardless of their complexity.
