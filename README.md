# Lighthouse Stack Packs

[Lighthouse](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse) provides developers with guidance to improve their site by auditing for performance, accessibility and other best practices.

Many developers today use different technologies (backend/CMS/JavaScript frameworks) to build their web pages. Instead of only surfacing general recommendations, what if Lighthouse could also provide more relevant and actionable advice depending on the tools used?

## Contributing

This is still under early development, but we would like to hear any suggestions from community members in the meantime. **[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is the first ecosystem we are supporting** and we plan on including a number of JavaScript frameworks and CMS platforms soon after.

Before contributing in any way, please read the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)!
